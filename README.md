# Hexnudge (WIP)

The goal for `hexnudge` is really really original: It's a color palate tool. The twist, however, is the interaction. Lots of color picker tools enforce interactions like dragging across gradients, tapping arrow keys against numeric values, and *if you're lucky* scaling. Often, RGB or CMYK values are separated from one another, each in their own field. `hexnudge` differs by displaying colors as text in the way we're used to seeing them. Here's where WIP bit comes in: once coloring behavior is under control & fully tested, scrolls, drags, and "nudgey" gestures will be first-class in the tool.
